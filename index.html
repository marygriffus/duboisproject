  <h2>W.E.B. Du Bois Project</h2>

  <p class="project intro">Welcome! W.E.B. Du Bois, famed author, editor, scholar, educator, and civil rights activist, created a beautiful set of graphs for the 1900 Paris Exposition. I was enthralled when I saw them, and as an exercise to push the limits of my data vis capabilities, I am replicating one of his graphs each week with d3, a JavaScript library. Hit "Toggle chart view" to switch between the original charts and my versions. Please drop me a line at m@marygriffus.com if you have any comments or questions!</p>
